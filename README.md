# kilocat

A port of [Salvatore Sanfilippo's kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) to [Umka](https://github.com/vtereshkov/umka-lang) + [catcurses](https://github.com/thacuber2a03/catcurses)
Based on [the Snaptoken tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo) by [Paige Ruten](https://github.com/paigeruten).

Besides syntax highlighting in multiline comments breaking down if you so much as look at them wrong... it's faithful enough to the tutorial.

## Building

Requires [UmBox](https://umbox.tophat2d.dev). (Currently does not work; the `catcurses` box isn't registered in the UmBox website yet)

Run `umbox update` and `umbox run`.

## License

This project is dedicated to [the public domain](./LICENSE). Partly because I want to forget about it, lol.
